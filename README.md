# docker-flyway-3x
This repository provides a Docker image for Flyway 3.x. 

# Why am I using this?
I'm working on a project that uses an old version of Flyway 3.x. The official boxfuse/flyway distribution doesn't go back that far so I'm creating this personal image to use myself in my development environment.
